Posing as a substitute music teacher at an elite private elementary school, he exposes his students to the hard rock gods he idolizes and emulates -- much to the consternation of the uptight principal (Joan Cusack). As he gets his privileged and precocious charges in touch with their inner rock 'n' roll animals, he imagines redemption at a local Battle of the Bands."

The footage was never seen and largely forgotten--until now. SUMMER OF SOUL shines a light on the importance of history to our spiritual well-being and stands as a testament to the healing power of music during times of unrest, both past and present. The feature includes never-before-seen concert performances by Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Sly & the Family Stone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Ray Baretto, Abbey Lincoln & Max Roach and more."

      "Description": "In the past, putting a missing person's picture on a milk carton was one of the most effective ways of locating the person. Now there are shows like \"Find Our Missing\" that are able to get the word out to a much larger group of people in attempts to find those who have disappeared. Hosted by Emmy-winning actress S. Epatha Merkerson, the hourlong series tells the stories of individuals, from the day they vanished to the search by investigators and loved ones to find them. Each episode profiles one or two people who have gone missing, including insight into their lives from the people who know them best. In addition to providing information into the investigations, the show provides contacts for the specific agencies handling each case."

The account of Fox's public life, full of nostalgic thrills and cinematic gloss, will unspool alongside his never-before-seen private journey, including the years that followed his diagnosis, at 29, with Parkinson's disease. Intimate and honest, and produced with unprecedented access to Fox and his family, the film will chronicle Fox's personal and professional triumphs and travails, and will explore what happens when an incurable optimist confronts an incurable disease. With a mix of adventure and romance, comedy and drama, watching the film will feel like... well, like a Michael J. Fox movie."

      "Description": "Based on the debut novel of the same name by writer Gillian Flynn (\"Gone Girl\"), the eight-episode series \"Sharp Objects\" stars Amy Adams, in her first major role on the small screen, as reporter Camille Preaker, who returns to her small hometown to investigate mysterious, unsolved crimes. Two girls are missing, one of whom was found dead and presumed murdered. As she searches for clues, Camille reunites with her estranged family -- overbearing mother Adora, stepfather Alan Crellin, and half sister Amma -- which rekindles traumatic childhood memories, including the death of her younger sister. Piecing together a psychological puzzle from her past, Camille begins to identify with the young victims a bit too closely."

Tom Hanks stars as Finch, a robotics engineer and one of the few survivors of a cataclysmic solar event that has left the world a wasteland. But Finch, who has been living in an underground bunker for a decade, has built a world of his own that he shares with his dog, Goodyear. He creates a robot, played by Caleb Landry Jones, to watch over Goodyear when he no longer can. As the trio embarks on a perilous journey into a desolate American West, Finch strives to show his creation, who names himself Jeff, the joy and wonder of what it means to be alive. Their road trip is paved with both challenges and humor, as it's as difficult for Finch to goad Jeff and Goodyear to get along as it is for him to manage the dangers of the new world."

For the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. Academy Award� nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar� nominee Salma Hayek). In their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided--against their better judgment--by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guill�n, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar� nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, \"Big\" Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos)."

When the Vicious 6 oust their leader, legendary fighter Wild Knuckles (Oscar� winner Alan Arkin), Gru interviews to become their newest member. It doesn't go well (to say the least), and only gets worse after Gru outsmarts them and suddenly finds himself the mortal enemy of the apex of evil. On the run, Gru will turn to an unlikely source for guidance, Wild Knuckles himself, and discover that even bad guys need a little help from their friends."

But Walker changes his mind before the inauguration, telling Underwood he's too valuable in Congress. Outwardly, Underwood accepts his marching orders, but secretly he and his wife Claire, an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Walker and his allies. As the series progresses, Underwood ascends through the ranks of the government -- until his death, at which point Claire gains power. Based on the U.K. miniseries of the same name, the U.S. version offers a look behind the scenes at the greed and corruption in American politics.

      "Description": "This British comedy series focuses on three priests living on Craggy Island -- a remote isle off the coast of Ireland. Father Ted Crilly is sent to the island as punishment for using money earmarked for a sick child and taking a holiday in Las Vegas (which he denies, of course). Fathers Dougal Maguire and Jack Hackett are his superiors, and Mrs. Doyle is their nosy housekeeper, who makes plentiful pots of tea. Naturally, the priests get into their fair share of somewhat sinful, madcap adventures."

      "Description": "Actor Seth Green (\"Family Guy\") and Matthew Senreich created the off-the-wall comedy hit, which is a series of pop-culture parodies using stop-motion animation of toys, action figures and dolls. The title character was an ordinary chicken until he was run down by a car and subsequently brought back to life in cyborg form by mad scientist Fritz Huhnmorder, who tortures Robot Chicken by forcing him to watch a random selection of TV shows, the sketches that make up the body of each episode. The show often features special episodes built around a single theme, including \"Star Wars\" and DC Comics."
